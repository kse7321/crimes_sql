# crimes_sql
Assignment for Database Systems class utilizing SQL queries, pandas, and heatmaps. This project displays my ability to write SQL and bring that data into pandas DataFrames in Python for further analysis. It also demonstrates that I can use gps coordinate data to produce geographical heatmaps via Folio.
I have added both the Python notebook and the pdf, as the ipynb document does not properly display the heatmaps in GitHub.
