# crimes_sql
Assignment for Database Systems class utilizing SQL queries, pandas, and heatmaps. This project displays my ability to write SQL and bring that data into pandas DataFrames in Python for further analysis. It also demonstrates standard statistical skills like applying smoothing filters to data and that I can use gps coordinate data to produce geographical heatmaps via Folio. 
I have added the pdf of my Jupyter notebook, as the notebook was larger than 25MB.
